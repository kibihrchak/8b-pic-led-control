# Overview

The aim is to improve upon the previous brightness lookup table test, by
introducing transition smoothing.

# Description

The LED PWM lookup table index change function has a period of 8
seconds. Each half-period consists out of two parts. In the first part
the output is a square function of time, in the second part, inverse of
the first part.

PWM duty cycle resolution is 10 bits.

# Hardware Setup

GP2 pin is used as PWM output. Other pins are unused (input).
