# Overview

The aim is to linearize the LED brightness, by providing the lookup
table which would map duty cycle, that is, current, that is, luminosity,
to brightness.

# Description

The LED PWM lookup table index change function is a triangle wave, with
period of 16 seconds.

PWM duty cycle resolution is 10 bits.

# Hardware Setup

GP2 pin is used as PWM output. Other pins are unused (input).
